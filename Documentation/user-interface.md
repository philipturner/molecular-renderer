# User Interface

With the renderer API, a window of your chosen resolution appears at program startup. You specify the monitor on which it appears, upscale factor (1x, 2x, 3x), and resolution after upscaling.

To close the window, click the "X" button at the top. You can also use `Cmd + W` (macOS) or `Ctrl + W` (Windows). On macOS, the window is typically out of focus when it first appears. Do not use `Cmd + W` until you click the window and bring it into focus.

The window does not register keyboard/mouse events or forward them to the program. This may change in the distant future, to allow interactive WASD-type navigation of a scene.
