# Tests: High Atom Count

## Rotating Beam

Objective is to reach as many atoms as possible, until the Metal Performance HUD shows the FPS dropping below the display's native refresh rate. Windows users can detect the drop by observing stuttering in the animation.

| Maximum Atom Count | macOS System | Windows System |
| ------------------ | -----------: | -------------: |
| Theoretical        | 1,546,000    | 954,000        |
| Actual             | ~934,000 (TODO) | TODO           |

In the source code, look for the declaration of `beamDepth`. The default value is 10. Increase this number as much as possible.

This test is bottlenecked by the system's CPU. There is room to improve by multithreading the Swift code for animating the beam and writing to `application.atoms`. For detailed explanation of the performance limits, study the source code in "Sources/MolecularRenderer/Atoms.swift".

## Long Distances

Test that hits the pain points of ray tracing. Long primary ray traversal times in the DDA, high divergence for AO rays. Not exactly stressing the BVH update process. Rather, a single unchanging BVH and a rotating camera to detect stuttering. Scaleable to different distances and window sizes.

The structure is a hydrogen-passivated, Si(100)-(2Ã—1) lattice generated with [`reconstruction.compile()`](https://github.com/philipturner/HDL/blob/main/Documentation/API/Reconstruction.md). The largest setting has 5.6 million atoms, takes over 10 seconds to compile, and causes issues with the GTX 970 running out of memory.

## Large Scenes

> TODO: Implement in the acceleration structure PR. We can make this more doable by removing the need to build the BVH super quick. Instead, just the camera rotating around the Y axis to survey the entire scene.

Objective is to reach as many atoms as possible, until your GPU runs out of memory.

The scene will take some time to design correctly. Expect it to hit challenging pain points for performance. It is a rigorous proof that I have achieved the ultimate goal of computer graphics.

| --------------- | -----: | --------------------: | ---------------: |
| GTX 970         | 3.5 GB | 33M   |     |
| M1 @ 60 Hz      |   8 GB | 75M   | n/a |
| M1 Pro @ 120 Hz |  16 GB | 150M  | n/a |
| 7900 XTX        |  24 GB | 225M  | n/a |
| RTX 4090        |  24 GB | 225M  | n/a |
| M1 Max          |  32 GB | 300M  |     |
| RTX 5090        |  32 GB | 300M  | n/a |
| M3 Max          | 128 GB | 1200M | n/a |
| M3 Ultra        | 512 GB | 4800M | n/a |

A large number of 100k atom cubes, each with a random orientation. All packed in a grid, with a spacing to ensure they don't overlap. This hits the pain points of partial filling that waste memory, therefore being a realistic example of achievable atom count.
