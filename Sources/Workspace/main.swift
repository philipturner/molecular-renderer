// Remaining tasks of this PR:
// - Implement the critical pixel count test; shouldn't take much time.
//   - Move the camera into the basis of the lattice, instead of the other
//     way around.
//   - Inspect the diamond and GaAs structures after compiling, to see the
//     cleaned up surfaces.
//   - Use a common lattice dimension for all structures. Start with a small
//     number, then scale it when other components of the test are working.
// - Clean up the documentation and implement the remaining tests.
